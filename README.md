# ArXiv Paper Recommendation System

The **ArXiv Paper Recommendation System** is a Python class-based project that allows you to discover and recommend academic papers from the arXiv repository based on textual similarity. This system leverages natural language processing techniques, including TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity, to suggest papers that are similar to a selected paper of interest.

## Features

- **Data Retrieval**: Automatically fetches academic paper metadata, including titles and abstracts, from arXiv within specific mathematical categories (e.g., math.CO, math.PR, math.ST).

- **TF-IDF Vectorization**: Utilizes TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization to convert paper abstracts into numerical vectors, capturing the importance of terms relative to the entire corpus.

- **Cosine Similarity**: Calculates cosine similarity scores between papers to determine their textual similarity based on TF-IDF vectors.

- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Provides a user-friendly Tkinter-based GUI for users to select a paper title and discover the top 5 most similar papers based on the selected paper.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up and run the ArXiv Paper Recommendation System using the provided Python class.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following libraries installed:

- `requests`
- `feedparser`
- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn` (for TF-IDF and cosine similarity)
- `tkinter` (for the GUI)

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install requests feedparser pandas scikit-learn
```

### Usage
1. Clone this repository or download the arxiv_recommendation.py file to your local machine.
2. Create an instance of the ArXivPaperRecommendationSystem class and call its methods:
```
if __name__ == "__main__":

    # Initialize the ArXiv Paper Recommendation System
    recommendation_system = ArXivPaperRecommendationSystem()

    # 1. Retrieve arXiv data
    recommendation_system.retrieve_arxiv_data()

    # 2. Calculate TF-IDF vectors and similarities
    recommendation_system.calculate_similarity()

    # 3. Create the GUI
    recommendation_system.create_gui()

    # 4. Run the system and start the Tkinter main loop
    recommendation_system.run()
```
3. The GUI will open, allowing you to select a paper title and find similar papers based on textual similarity.
